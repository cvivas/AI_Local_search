An old project at the university for the "Artificila Intelligence" courses. 

The Project consisted in using Heuristics and Local Search Algorithms to solve a problem, Specifically Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. 

We had a logistics problem to solve. From a transportation company's point of view, we had to manage the deliveries from one logistics warehouse to a series of production centers. We had to optimize the revenues, and for that we had to take into consideration in our different heuristics functions some of the following:

Number of trucks
Different truck capacity
Quantity of product asked
Delivering deadlines
Penalties for being late
Number and Type of Orders
 
We used AIMA, a Java implementation of algorithms from Norvig and Russell's Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach 3rd Edition
